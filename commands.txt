# kafka-stock-market-project

A Python and Kafka stock market project also includes AWS Glue and AWS Athena, also there are producers and consumers

## Make an EC2 instance and SSH into it through cmd:

wget https://downloads.apache.org/kafka/3.9.1/kafka_2.13-3.9.1.tgz
tar -xzf kafka_2.13-3.9.1.tgz

sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install java-11-amazon-corretto-devel -y
java -version
This installs Java 11, which is recommended in modern Kafka environments

cd kafka_2.13-3.9.1

## Start Zoo-keeper:

bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

Open another window to start kafka
One cmd has zookeeper and other one has kafka
SSH into your other cmd as well as done before

Enter in a new console --
export KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS="-Xmx256M -Xms128M"
This increases the memory

cd kafka_2.13-3.9.1

The kafka is pointing to private server , change server.properties so that it can run in public IP
To do this , you can follow any of the 2 steps shared below:
Do a "sudo nano config/server.properties"
change ADVERTISED_LISTENERS to public ip of the EC2 instance

bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

Also make changes in th security group of the EC2
Edit inbound rule
Then All Traffic -> "Anywhere-IPv4" instead of "My IP"

Open third cmd
Repeat

## Create the topic:

cd kafka_2.13-3.9.1
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic demo_test --bootstrap-server {Put the Public IP of your EC2 Instance}:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1

## Start Producer:

bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic demo_test --bootstrap-server {Put the Public IP of your EC2 Instance}:9092

## Start Consumer:

Make fourth cmd
Repeat

Enter in a new console --
cd kafka_2.13-3.9.1
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic demo_test --bootstrap-server {Put the Public IP of your EC2 Instance}:9092
